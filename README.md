# ðŸŽ¥ Canva Edits â€” Product Storytelling Through Design

Welcome to my creative sandbox! While preparing for software engineering roles, Iâ€™ve also explored the art of product storytelling through video editing and graphic design. This repository features select Canva-based projects that visually communicate technical ideas, user journeys, and product features.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters in Tech

In modern software development, clarity and communication are just as critical as code. These videos reflect:
- **UX Thinking** â€” Simulating user flows and feature interactions.
- **Technical Communication** â€” Breaking down complex systems into digestible visuals.
- **Product Awareness** â€” Designing launch reels and explainers that resonate with users and stakeholders.


## ðŸ§° Tools Used

## ðŸš€ Engineering Meets Creativity

These projects arenâ€™t just hobbiesâ€”theyâ€™re proof that design and engineering go hand-in-hand. Whether itâ€™s a UI demo or video editing, I believe in making tech accessible, engaging, and human-centered.
